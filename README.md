# Background

iPods store various information in what are called, "iTunesDB files". Despite the name, these are not "real" database (eg Postgres) files, but, instead binary files.

There are several types of iTunesDB files, but their purpose is mostly centered around storing information for what kind of media (photos, videos) is on that device, and information attached to that media.

(To add to the confusion, there is also a specific file itself called "iTunesDB".)

The format for iTunesDB files was reverse-engineered by the [iPod Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPodLinux) team. The documentation for them is here: http://www.ipodlinux.org/ITunesDB

# About

This repository contains a parser/extractor for iTunesDB files, written in Rust. The parser is located in the `parser` directory.

The table below shows which iTunesDB files are supported.

In examining your iPod's file system you'll find other types of files besides the one listed above. These are:

-   [`.plist` files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_list)

-   [`.tone` files](https://github.com/raleighlittles/iPod_tone_file_player)

-   `alarms` files: https://github.com/raleighlittles/iTunesDB-Parser/issues/6

-   `.itdb` files, which are just SQLite 3 databases with a different extension.

Because iPodLinux isn't maintained anymore, I was worried that the website (and thus the iTunesDB wiki) would be taken down at some point, so I downloaded the documentation.

Both the original website, and a markdown-formatted version are in the `itunesdb_docs` folder.

## Limitations 

There is a known issue where, sometimes, not all of a user's songs are corrected detected from the iTunesDB file. I am still unsure what causes this issue but its been observed with more recent iTunesDB files. If this happens to you, please open an issue and be prepared to provide extra information about your system.

# Code and usage

The parser is written in Rust. You can build it by running `cargo build`.

It requires two arguments:

(1) the iTunesDB filename,

(2) the type of iTunesDB file.

The possible "type" options are:

| Field         | Value                                    |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| "photo"       | Photos Database files, no iThmb files    |
| "itunes"      | iTunes DB (music and podcasts only) file |
| "itprefs"     | iTunes Preferences file                  |
| "playcounts"  | Playcounts file                          |
| "pfalbums"    | Photo Folder Albums                      |
| "preferences" | Preferences file                         |
| "deviceinfo"  | DeviceInfo file                          |
| "equalizer"   | Equalizer Presets file                   |
| "itunessd"    | iTunesSD file (standard)                 |
| "itunessd_3g" | iTunesSD specifically for 3rd generation |

```bash
$ cd iTunesDB-Parser/parser
$ cargo build
$ ./target/debug/itunesdb_parser <path-to-itunesdb-file> '<type>'
```

For iTunesDB, iTunesSD (3rd gen only), Photos Database, Equalizer files, and Playcounts files, a CSV will be generated with all the relevant information. For example, if you run it on an iTunesDB file, the output CSV will contain the info for all songs and podcasts mentioned in the iTunesDB file. iTunesDB files have the option of exporting to JSON instead of CSV.

![CSV podcast screenshot](./docs/2023122_podcasts-csv.png)

If you run it on a Photo Database file, you'll see the list of all images stored on that iPod.

Equalizer settings CSV: ![Equalizer settings CSV screenshot](./docs/20241126_equalizer-csv-example.png)

You can see examples of the files produced in the `samples/output` directory.

# Extras

There's 2 extra utilities that may be of use:

-   Spotify integration: This creates a Spotify playlist out of the songs that were found on your iPod. You first use this tool to extract the CSV file from the iTunesDB file, then call the script with that CSV file. See repository: https://github.com/raleighlittles/iTunes-Spotify-Integration

-   Song renaming functionality: iPods (generally ?) store the song files on their hard drive, however, the filenames are usually just a generic unique ID. I wrote a Python script that lets you rename the songs to have the song title and artist name instead, using the data that is in the iTunesDB file. See the README in that directory for more information.

# Future roadmap

This project is a very early work-in-progress. The next major feature to come is [iThumb file decoding](https://github.com/raleighlittles/iTunesDB-Parser/issues/4)
