Marques, Andrew, and David kick it off talking about the Apple Vision Pro before pivoting into Google turning on RCS by default on Android. After that, they discuss two new foldables that might be coming soon and talk about the state of the foldable market in general. Then, we end it with a fun new game we're calling ""Break the Budget"" where the hosts need to pick three tech items without going over a given budget. It's chaotic but a ton of fun! Make sure you stick around to the end for the trivia answers as always. Enjoy!
